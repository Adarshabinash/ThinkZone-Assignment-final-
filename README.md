Here, I have made a simple react form using the required tags.

For the validation process, I have used react-hook-form and yup validator.
Both react-hook-form and yup validator makes it easy to create a form and help in validating it.
In yup, we have to create a schema for our input field and have to use yup-resolver to be able to integrate this schema to our form.
